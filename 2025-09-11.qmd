  p1: 'Choose either the Nazi medical experiments or the Tuskegee syphilis study and reflect on what that case teaches us about the need for ethical safeguards in research. Why do you think these events had such a lasting impact on how research is conducted today? How might studying these cases shape your behavior as a future researcher?'
  p2: 'Imagine you are researching a public social media platform like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, or TikTok. Would you consider the content you’re analyzing to be public or private? Would you need to obtain informed consent? Why or why not? Reflect on the ethical gray areas that emerge in digital research and how you would navigate them.'
  p3: 'Think ahead to a study you might conduct as part of this course. What would it look like to fully honor the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice in your research? Identify at least one concrete action you would take during your study’s design or data collection to uphold each of these three ethical principles.'

## Response

<!-- RESPONSE-START -->

\*If I was researching a social media site like X, Reddit, or TikTok, I would see most of the content posted as public just because anyone can usually look at posts, comments, or videos. But just because something is public does not always mean the person who posted it expected it to be studied/quoted in research by professionals. A lot of people, including myself, write online in a way that feels casual even if others can't see it that way. This can make the line between "public" and "private" less clear. When thinking about consent, it depends on how I use the content. If I was only looking at the general patterns, such as hashtags or numbers of likes, then I probably wouldn't need informed consent since I'm not focusing on specific people. But if I was quoting individual posts, showing usernames, I would either need their permission or to remove any identifying details so their privacy is protected. The ethical challenge is finding the right balance between what is technically accessible and what is fair to the people who created it. The way I see it is "Just because I CAN post, doesn't mean I always SHOULD post." I think to handle this, I would try to anonymize the data and always think about if the material could cause harm. This way I am respecting both the public nature of social media and the rights of the people who share their lives on these platforms. <!-- RESPONSE-END -->
